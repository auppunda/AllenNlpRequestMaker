# sample_request

To make a request on the endpoint \predict run command: 

`python request.py -u "http://localhost:8000" -a "\predict" -d data.json -o out.json`

-u is the endpoint for the demo (in our case it is http://localhost:8000) and -d is the data you are sending over. -o is the output file.
