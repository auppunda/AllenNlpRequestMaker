    "For each endpoint there are a few calls possible. Each endpoint has a GET at that endpoint, a POST to /endpoint/predict, a POST to /endpoint/interpret/interpret_id, and a POST to /endpoint/attack/attack_id. The main ones that you will probably need to use are interpret and predict. In the GUI, when you click run it runs the predict endpoint on that model. Since for this server there is no ui available, we can manually just run the predict at whichever endpoint you need. \n",
